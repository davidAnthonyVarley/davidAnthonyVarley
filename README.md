### Hi there, my name is David Varley, and I am currently studying Computer Science (Major) & Business (Minor) in Trinity College DublinðŸ‘‹
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Algorithms & Data Structures
- My projects include, but are not limited to:

-   Integrating GPT 4.0 into a client's website to analyse a patient's (WHO-standardised formatted) Labratory Results 
-
