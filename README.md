### Hi there, my name is David Varley, and I am an aspiring system architect studying Computer Science (Major) & Business (Minor) in Trinity College DublinðŸ‘‹
  My projects include:

-   Integrating GPT 4.0 into a client's website to analyse a patient's (WHO-standardised formatted) Labratory Results
-   Building an interactive AI Taxonomy Builder with Quantexa as a backend developer, as part of a software engineering module
-   Designing and implementing a caching system to optimise Youtube's latency and cache storage (from 2017 Google Hashcode Competition)
-   
-   a 3D graphics engine, built from the ground up
-   controlling a SoC with ARM Assembly Language
-   a full-stack bus timetable app
  
 Iâ€™m currently researching, and plan to research, all of AWS's infrastructure services (the problems they solve and how they're implemented), SQL, CI/CD, Docker, containerisation, Bash + Powershell and computer hardware (I have my work cut out ;) )!
